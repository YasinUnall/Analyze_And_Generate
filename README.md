# Analyze and Generate AI

This program will read the data.txt file and analyze the words in that. Then it will make some assumptions based on that data.
After this process you can use this program to generate more words like that.

- basic_frequency.ipynb: Basic frequency table version, coded by using python and pytorch. This aproach is based on the char bigrams of the data.txt words.
- basic_neural_network.ipynb: Basic neural network version, coded by using python and pytorch. This is based on creating a neural network with a seed. Then we use Gradient Descent algorithm to optimize our neural network to get better results. In this case we are using data.txt file to test our optimization results and creating our character library.
